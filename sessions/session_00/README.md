The following describes what we would like you to do before the first session of the course _Analysis, Design and Software Architecture_ on Wednesday, Aug. 27th (12:00).

We would like that you prepare the following three things:

  * [A) Register accounts](#A-register-accounts)
  * [B) Setup workstation](#B-setup-workstation)

In case you have problems with installation of any of the tools, do not despair.
You will be able to ask the TAs for help during the first exercise session on Wednesday, Aug. 27th (14:00).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# A) Register accounts

## Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com)

If you do not have an account on [GitHub](https://github.com) yet, sign-up via https://github.com/signup

Note, in this course we are using [GitHub.com](https://github.com) **not** [ITU's GitHub instance](https://github.itu.dk/).


## GitHub Student Developer Pack

Sign up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/experiences/virtual_event_kit) to receive free credit for Azure services.
Some of which, we will use later in the course.
