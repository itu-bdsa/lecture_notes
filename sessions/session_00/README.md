The following describes what we would like you to do before the first session of the course _Analysis, Design and Software Architecture_ on Thursday, Aug. 31th (10:00).

We would like that you prepare the following three things:

  * [A) Survey](#A-survey)
  * [B) Register accounts](#B-register-accounts)
  * [C) Setup workstation](#C-setup-workstation)

In case you have problems with installation of any of the tools, do not despair.
You will be able to ask the TAs for help during the first exercise session on Thursday, Aug. 31th (14:00).

# A) Survey

If you do not have an account on [GitHub](https://github.com) yet, sign-up via https://github.com/signup
