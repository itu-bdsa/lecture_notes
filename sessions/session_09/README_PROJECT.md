You have to work on the following topics.

- [Your turn now! -- Project Work](#your-turn-now----project-work)
  - [1) Software Development](#1-software-development)


Remember, you have to perform work on each topic and on **each** bullet point.
Be done with the project work before we meet again next week.


## 1) Software Development

### Complete Login

If not done yet, complete your implementation of login functionality.
Users have to be able to log into your _Chirp!_ applications with GitHub.

### Complete Sending of Cheeps

If not done yet, complete your implementation that allows users to send cheeps.

### Security Harden your application

Now, that you accept cheeps from users, make sure that your _Chirp!_ application is not susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) or SQL injection attacks, see chapters 29.1 and 29.4.2 in the course book Andrew Lock _ASP.NET Core in Action, Third Edition_.
