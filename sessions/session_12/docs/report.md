# Design and Architecture of _Chirp!_

## Domain Model

Here comes a description of our domain model.

![Illustration of the _Chirp!_ data model as UML class diagram.](docs/images/domain_model.png)

## Architecture — In the small

## Architecture of deployed application

## User activities

## Sequence diagram

With a UML sequence diagram, illustrate the flow of messages and data through your _Chirp!_ application.
Start with an HTTP request that is send by an unauthorized user to the root endpoint of your application and end with the completely rendered web-page that is returned to the user.

Make sure that your illustration is complete.
That is, likely for many of you there will be different kinds of "calls" and responses.
Some HTTP calls and responses, some calls and responses in C# and likely some more.
(Note the previous sentence is vague on purpose. I want that you create a complete illustration.)

# Process

## Build, test, release, and deployment

Illustrate with a UML activity diagram how your _Chirp!_ applications are build, tested, released, and deployed.
That is, illustrate the flow of activities in your respective GitHub Actions workflows.
